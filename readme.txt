Jankiest purpose-built text management "engine" for the lexffe blog.

Should have adopted a proper CMS but this is a good practice too.

This repo is the backend for lexffe.io.

roadmap for v3:

- tags
- multimedia assets
- (content management system?)

v4:

- backend modularise
  - split handlers and models into modules
  -> for backend.lexffe.xyz
